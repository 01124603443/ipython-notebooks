========================

Placeholder for code related to Andrew Ng's machine learning class on Coursera.  

I'm planning to use IPython notebooks to show the steps needed to arrive at a solution for the programming exercises.  To that end, I'm also adding an "intro" notebook that includes some useful examples from the python language and tool stack.

Notebook viewer links are below.
